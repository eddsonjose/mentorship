            <p>Catherine Thy Le was born in Southern Caifornia. From a young age, I was interested
            and found myself becoming immersed in the arts. I started off with simple pencil sketches
            and worked my way up to different mediums like ink, watercolor, and acrylic paint. As I entered
            high school, I started to take my traditional art more seriously and was also intorduced to the
            worlds of design and digital artwork. Now, I am persuing a BFA in Digital Media Art at San Jose
            State University and working on learning more about digital art.<br><br>As an artist, I don't
            limit myself to what I can do. Digital and traditional
            mediums are all fair game for me. I use mediums that I find interesting, those in which
            I would like to hone in my skills with. The same can be said for my subject matter. I create
            artwork based off of what catches my eye. A recreation of landscapes, faces, objects, all through
            my own lense. With my art, I want to provide the viewer an emotional experience- one where they feel
            happiness, peace, sadness, shock, anger, awe. I belive the beauty of art lies within how it
            able to connect complete strangers regardless of their identity and background and I would like to
            provide that same space with my own art in the future.<br><br>Â© Catherine Thy Le. All Rights Reserved.</p>
